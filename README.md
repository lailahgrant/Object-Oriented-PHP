## Objects
> What is an Object?
>
> - In OOP we combine **`related variables and functions`** into a **`cohensive unit`** which we call an **OBJECT**.
> - [x] An object groups related `variables` and `functions`.
> 
> For example
> - On Amazon, a user can be an objetc, a cart can be an object
> - On Spotify; [Objects related to a playlist function can be - name, creator, song count, length]
>
> - [x] `Properties`: Variables which belong to objects.
> 
> Functionalities that can be performed on the Spotify playlist:-
> - Play the playlist, go to next song, enable repeat,
> All this **functionality** can be handled by `Methods`
> 
> - [x] `Methods`: name of functions that belong to objects.

#### Benefits of OOP (Why OOP exists)
- [x] The data and the functions that operate on that data are grouped together (`Encapsulation`).
- [ ] Reduced complexity 
- [ ] Allows for  reuse
- [ ] Changes only need to happen in one place
- [ ] Code is better otganized and more coherent
- [ ] Makes it easy to visualize the design of your application
- [ ] **OOP is your friend!**

#### Where do objects come from? How do we create them?
> Create Classes
- [x] To create an object, you need a `Class`
> What is a Class?
> - A Class is a blueprint tha defines what an object will look like, what's it's attributes are.
